- 👋 Hi, I’m @nicoleweathers
- 👀 I've been building websites from scratch since the late 90s. I love coding/scripting and learning different programming languages.
- 🌱 I wish I had of been introduced to Github a long time ago because it is the perfect place for people like me.
- 💞️ I build all my websites on the WordPress platform because I love how I can still use my own designs a and edit themes to fit different projects, while also using a great CMS like WordPRess.
- 📫 If you need to reach me, just visit my website @ nicoleweathers.com
